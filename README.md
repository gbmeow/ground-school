## Lift formula 
L = (1/2) d v2 s CL
[Math Exercises]([https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/WindTunnel/Activities/lift_formula.html)


## Simulator Tests 

### At the same speed, adding flaps, will give you a boost in LIFT 
Reaction from pilot: reduce AOA, to prevent the lift from balooning you up.
Note: The drag will be slower to slow you down, then the lift you will be getting.
@1000 ft altitude
    L = (1/2) d v2 s CL
@2000 ft altitude
    L = (1/2) d v2 s CL(â†‘)
    
[Add flaps for more lift - Why?](http://www.boldmethod.com/blog/2013/10/how-does-lowering-flaps-affect-angle-of-attack/)
    

### Stall speed due to load factor 
    45 bank 
    80 bank 
Reaction from pilot: Increase lift via airspeed (nose up -- do not exeed critical angle of attack)


### Lift in decent vs. climb 
Air speed: 70 kts 
Reaction from pilot:
    Climb - 
    Descend - 
Are we getting the same lift?

### Flying upside down 
Reaction from pilot: Increase AOA upside down && push nose down


### Snaking through the air 
Reaction from pilot: Anticipate the coupling of movement - 
    yaw-roll
    pitch-roll
    pitch-yaw 
    turning-yaw

## Emergancy Training 
### Pitch stability lost (no functioning elevator)

### GO around - failed approach 
Reaction from pilot: Retract flaps in stages, otherwise you will loose a lot of lift 


### Engine quits - why we cannot stay in level flight 
    drag?
    or lift?
