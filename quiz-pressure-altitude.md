## Pressure Altitude 
1. If airport is at elevation of 3427' and today the altimeter setting is: 30.12". What is the pressure altitude? 
  Answer: 3227"
  Explanation: 
        Normal pressure altitude is: 3427'(@ 29.92") today your are below sea level (@30.12")  
          - take the diffrence (YOUR ALTERMETER SETTING 30.12" - STANDARD ALTIMETER SETTING 29.92" = 0.2") 
          - knowing: 1" = 1000ft - -- math: 0.2" * 1000ft = 200ft
          - now where you higher or lower then sea level? lower {so to get pressure altitude - you need to subtract or add?
            - well I am lower the sea level - so subtract 
          = 3227"
