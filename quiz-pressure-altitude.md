## Pressure Altitude (Due to air pressure - how will my plane perform - as if it were higher or lower then standard sea level)
1. If airport is at elevation of 3427'(ft) and today the altimeter setting is: 30.12". What is the pressure altitude? 
  Answer: 3227' (ft)
  Explanation: 
        Normal pressure altitude is: 3427'(@ 29.92") today your are below sea level (@30.12")  
          - take the diffrence (YOUR ALTERMETER SETTING 30.12" - STANDARD ALTIMETER SETTING 29.92" = 0.2") 
          - knowing: 1" = 1000ft - -- math: 0.2" * 1000ft = 200ft
          - now where you higher or lower then sea level? lower {so to get pressure altitude - you need to subtract or add?
            - well I am lower the sea level - so subtract 
          = 3227'

2. If airport is at elevation of 4500' and today the altimeter setting is: 28.82". What is the pressure altitude? 
  Answer: 5500'
  Explanation: I am higher then normal sea level - so my plane would perform as if it were higher? so add 


## Density Altitude
1. What then is the standard temperature for an airport with an elevation of 2000’?
  Answer: 15°C - 4°C = 11°C
  Explanation:
2. What is the density altitude of an airport with an elevation of 4,500’ when the altimeter setting is 28.92”Hg., and the temperature is 28° C.?
  Answer: 7700'
  Explanation:
      Equation to the rescue: Density Altitude = Pressure Altitude + (100 ´ * [actual temperature – (standard temperature - lapse rate (2°C/1000ft)] )
      Standard temp @ sea level = 15°C
      - Density Altitude = 5500' + (100' * [28°C - (15°C- (4500/1000 = 9°C)])
      - Density Altitude = 5500' + (100' * [22°C])
      = 5500' + 2200' = 7700'
